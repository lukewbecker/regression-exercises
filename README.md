# Regression Exercises README

## Purpose of Repository
- House exercises for Regression module classwork (Codeup Training Course)
- Practice for continually updating my repo on a daily basis
- Libraries in use:
    - Python
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - seaborn
    - sklearn

## Summary of Respository and Module:
In this module, we will analyze, visualize and model various labeled datasets that are being stored in SQL and have continuous target variables. This means we will do supervised machine learning (because the data is labeled) using regression (because the target variable we are analyzing is continuous) on structured data (because the data can be naturally stored in rows and columns).
